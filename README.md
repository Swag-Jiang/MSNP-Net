# MSNP-Net
This repository is for paper 《Multi-scale noise-guided progressive network for image splicing detection and localization》</br>
In this work, we propose a dual-branch Multi-Scale Noise-Guided Progressive Network (MSNP-Net) . The multi-resolution branch extracts deep semantic features of images while suppressing redundant noise. A multi-scale noise-guided branch is designed to capture more subtle tampering artifacts and guide the network to strengthen the learning of spatial structure features. The
two branches complement and restrict each other. The features of different scales are fused in a gradual mechanism, and the feature expression is aggregated through the spatial channel feature aggregation module (SCAM) . A large number of experiments show that the MSNP-Net proposed in this paper has better completeness and lower false alarm rate for the detection and localization of spliced images.It can achieve more refined detection results, and has good stability and robustness. Significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
